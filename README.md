### Check Files Gui
This project functions as a phonebook for a user. The program uses tkinter and saves contact name's, phone numbers, and email address' into a database and allows uers to delete and update previously stored entries.
### File Transfer Gui
This Gui allows users to transfer .txt files from one folder to another. These files that are moved will be saved in a database.
### Checkbook Project
This project acts as an online checkbook. It was made using Django. It allows users to create an account, create a transaction log for their money, and then they are able to view or update the log.
